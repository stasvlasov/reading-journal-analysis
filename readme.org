** What is R?
- Cutting-edge Statistical Software
- Programming Language to operate it
- Free, open-source, huge community
- Main Toolbox for Data Scientists

** Basic set up
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
1. Install R (download from CRAN - http://www.r-project.org/) 
2. Install external GUI
   - RStudio (download from https://www.rstudio.com/)
   - Other third party GUIs (Emacs, Eclips, etc.)

** Basic elements in R
| *Numeric*   | 100, 0, -4.335   |
| *Character* | ”some letters”   |
| *Logical*   | TRUE, FALSE      |
| *Factor*    | Different levels |
| *Complex*   | 2 + 3i           |
| *Missing*   | NA, NULL, NaN    |

** Basic Types of R Objects
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  - /Vectors/ 
  - /Matrix/ 
  - /Array/ - Multidimensional /Matrix/ 
  - /Dataframe/ - Set of /Vectors/ of the same length (but can be of different types) 
  - /List/ - Set of different objects (can also include /Lists/) 
  - /Closure/ - functions (instructions of what to do)
 

** Basic syntax of R

# This is a comment

# This is a number. Number is a basic type of element.
42

# This is a Boolean. It is also a basic type of element.
TRUE

# This is a string. And this is also a basic type of element.
"John Bechara coordinates our course very well"

# This function c() creates an object of type vector that contains 3 strings
c("Noah", "Koen", "Geert")

# Actually when you create a vector containing one element (a number)
42

# This is a function being called with two arguments
paste("a","b")

# This is a function with an optional named argument
paste("a","b",sep=",")

# This is assignment. This is how you create objects of different types.
x <- c("Sjoerd", "Pauline", "Céline", "Kiki", "Marloes", "Patricia", "Sharon", "Lisa")
y <- seq(1,16,by=2)  # the first 8 odd numbers

# This is how to extract parts of a vector
x[2]  # "Pauline"
x[c(1,2,4)]  # c("Sjoerd", "Pauline", "Kiki")
x[3:5]  # try yourself

# This is how to bind two vectors to form a matrix
m <- rbind(x, y)
m <- cbind(x, y)

# This is how to slice a matrix
m[1,]  # the first row
m[,1]  # the first column
m[2:3,1]  # the first element of the second and third row
